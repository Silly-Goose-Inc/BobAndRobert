Hello:

I am reaching out with an opportunity that is both extraordinary and deeply urgent—one that could tie your museum to the legacy of one of the most important classical artists of our time.

Robert Cremean, a visionary whose work blended profound historical reflection with sculptural mastery, left behind pieces that demand preservation. Among them is A Maquette for the End of Time—a haunting and powerful monument to the victims of Hiroshima. This work is not only an artistic achievement but a statement on loss, survival, and the weight of history. It belongs in a space where it can be understood, honored, and shared with future generations.

Right now, this irreplaceable piece is in danger. Without a permanent home, it will likely be lost—discarded, erased from the record of history. This is a masterpiece that deserves to be seen, to be contemplated, to spark conversation and remembrance. Given your museum’s dedication to the Japanese American experience, there may be no better place for it.

If there is any possibility that your institution could house this work or even discuss a path forward, please reach out. Simply: time is running out. Once lost, this piece cannot be recovered.

Please let me know when we can speak further. This is more than an acquisition—it is a chance to ensure that history is not forgotten. More information about this work can be found at This link from FLICKR

Best wishes,

Fisher Armstrong & Teresa Drummond - On behalf of the Estate of Robert Cremean
